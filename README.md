# Ball Tracker
Ball tracker based on the color of the ball. Uses traditional computer vision techniques to isolate the color of the ball and then find the ball based off the color threshold image.

Included in the source is a prgram that lets you find the HSV values you want in case you want to change the values or the values are not working for you. This might be turned into its own repository since I use it for multiple applications for finding HSV ranges.
